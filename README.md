# e_Commerce_Back_End

## Description

I have created (with the help of starter code) a back end e-commerce site that will allow the application owner to build out everything they need for their online store. They will be able to add their own categorys, products and tag those products so that they and the user both are able to narrow down their search and or have more options when shopping around. The app user would be able to use all of the CRUD functionallity to create, read, update and delete any of these models as they see fit.
